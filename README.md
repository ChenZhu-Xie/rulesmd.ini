## Inplementation
0. Provide Xcc_Mixer.exe to extract .ini for each mod from the .mix file,  
    * Generally speaking, the extraction target is expand.mix,
    * but it could be expandmd.mix (Related to Yuri's Revenge), etc.
1. There are 17 original and modified rules.ini files of old mods(' versions) in the folder,  
    * The (prefix part "rules" of) name "rules.ini" may vary from mod to mod,
        * similiar to the "expand.mix" case.
2. The .pdf file provides "instances" to modify different mods' rules.ini files.
    * The modification of rules.ini files across different mods is similar.
    * It is easier to modify rules.ini across versions of the same mod,
        * e.g., the modified rulesmo.ini for mo-3.3.6 has now been added.
